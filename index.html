    <h1>King David</h1>
    <p> <blockquote>
     According to 1 Samuel, David was the youngest son of Jesse, a man of Bethlehem, and served as a shepherd for his father before beginning his career as an aide at the court of Saul, Israel’s first king. When Israel came into conflict with the Philistines, a people from a neighbouring region, David’s brothers went to fight for King Saul. Young David would travel back and forth to the camp to bring his brothers food and supplies. According to 1 Samuel 17, Goliath, a heavily armed Philistine giant, challenged Saul for 40 days to send out a man to fight him. No one would face this warrior until David, armed only with a sling and stones, volunteered. David hit the giant in the forehead with a stone and killed him. He continued to distinguish himself as a warrior in the ongoing battles against the Philistines, and his resultant popularity aroused Saul’s jealousy. Fearing that the people would make David king, Saul plotted to kill him. With the help of his loyal friend Jonathan, Saul’s eldest son, David fled into southern Judah and Philistia, on the coastal plain of Palestine, where, with great sagacity and foresight, he began to lay the foundations of his career.

    <p><blockquote>
     As an outlaw with a price on his head, David led the life of a Robin Hood on the desert frontier of his tribal domain in Judah (in the south of the Levant). He became the leader and organizer of a group of other outlaws and refugees, who progressively ingratiated themselves with the local population by protecting them from other bandits or, in case they had been raided, by pursuing the raiders and restoring the possessions that had been taken. Although the boy David was anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16), his actions in exile helped ensure that he would be “invited” to become king as the true successor of Saul after Saul and Jonathan were slain in battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa.

  <p> <blockquote>

     The exploits of David and the events of his monarchy are related in 2 Samuel. After mourning the death of Saul and executing an Amalekite who claimed to have killed the former king, David began to consolidate his position as the successor to Saul. He was proclaimed king of Judah in Hebron while Ishbosheth, Saul’s eldest surviving son, reigned in northern Israel, and a long war of attrition developed between the two houses. Ishbosheth’s position became exceedingly insecure following the death of his general, Abner. He was eventually beheaded by his own courtiers, whom David, in turn, executed for murdering the last ruler of the house of Saul. David made a covenant with the elders of northern Israel and was then anointed as king over all of Israel.
